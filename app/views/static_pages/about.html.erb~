    <h3>One Extra Project...</h3>
    <p>There's only one project you won't find on the "classes" page, this one! You'll find the technical details on the side.</p>
    <p>I had originally created a static page for my portfolio, but found that it was really complicated to go in and edit the html for
    every single project I'd created, so instead I spent a ton of time making this dynamic website. It still has a lot of kinks to work out,
    but I'm really proud of the end result!</p>
    <p>This site is still a work in progress, so expect a lot of changes. The next item on my list is finishing the resume page, hopefully that'll be done soon!</p>

      <h3>Bootstrap: a love story.</h3>
      <p>Take a look at my first Rails app. I included Bootstrap, but had no idea how to use it properly. Eventually, I looked through
      the bootstrap documentation, and fell in love. So much time and effort is saved by using bootstrap. I couldn't believe it.
      Now it's hard to believe I ever wrote all that CSS for my previous website. However, there were some problems implementing it with
      Rails</p>
      <h3>Whoops</h3>
      <p>For my Classes page, I wanted each class to be in a jumbotron with an image set in the background. Unfortunately, you can't
        hard code in a style with bootstrap, so I hade to remove the .jpg extension from each of my <code>:image_url</code>s and create a 
        class that would change the background of the jumbotron, named after the result of<code>@project_group.image_url.gsub(".jpg", "")</code>
      This means that every time I want to add an image I have to add a CSS class for that image, which is definitely sub-optimal. Fixing that is definitely high
      on my todo list.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p>Despite all of its problems, it's really nice to have a wonderful, mobile-first, framework to use. I think I'll be using bootstrap a 
    lot more in the future, and look forward to unlocking it's full potential.</p>

      <h3>The zen of Ruby</h3>
      <p>I chose Ruby on Rails for a number of reasons. One is that there are a number of (great) free online resources that
      allowed to me learn Ruby on my own. Another is that something about the Ruby way appeals to me. The language isn't incredibly
      syntax-oriented, it mostly reads like plain English. For example, </p>
      <pre>
        &lt;%=@projects.each do |p|%&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;&lt;%= p.name %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;%end%&gt;</pre>
      <p>would list the titles of every project, and it's not too hard to infer that from the code, whereas with languages like
        Java or C++ you'd have to write a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
      <p>Everything you do in Rails makes sense. You have a controller which controls the actions associated with an object. You have
      the Model which defines properties of the object. You have a view which a user can interact with. Using Rails has helped my understanding
      of databases and server-side interactions greatly. I definitely know a lot more than I used to about web-development. The rails projects
      I've done have also introduced me to Git and Github, and also got me to use the Command Line a lot more than I used to. </p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class ="row">
    <div class ="col-md-12"
    <p>Rails has introduced me to a whole new world. I had a surprising amount of fun working on this project, and I definitely want to
    do more of this in the future. Hopefully as time goes on and I gain more experience I can fix some of the issues I had with this site, and 
    optimize the site in some areas. I'm also very curious about other web frameworks, and would like to try those out as well.</p>

      <h1>So what now?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Now, I move forward, like I always have. I'm thinking about adding a blog portion to this site, we'll see how that goes. I'm also going
    to try and work on a few websites for friends and family, I'll link those in the Extracurricular group if I ever get around to it. Other than that,
    work, school, play. The usual. </p>
    <p>If you actually read through all that, I want to thank you. Thank you for taking the time to read through all of that pointless exposition. Thank
      you for being interested in this site. It means a lot to me. Once again, If you have any questions whatsoever, email me at <a href="mailto:josh.nichols.lives@gmail.com">josh.nichols.lives@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p> A million thanks, </p>
